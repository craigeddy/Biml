Welcome to my Biml Demos.

This is where you can find the code from any of my current presentations. Feel free to submit [issues](https://github.com/shannonlowder/Biml/issues) you find in my demos.  I'm also open to requests for new demos.  Just let me know what you'd like to see!

[Interrogator](http://shannonlowder.com/biml-interrogator-demo/) -- extract metadata from your data sources. This is most helpful for dealing with your flat files.  [Read more] (http://shannonlowder.com/biml-interrogator-demo/) on how to use the project.

[DataTypeConversion](http://toyboxcreations.net/datatype-conversion-utility-for-biml/) -- need to convert back and forth between Biml, SQL Server, and SSIS datatypes?  Get my utility in this repo!


Notes:
20170523 sdl -- learning how to manually edit a .dtproj file so I can reference the existing files from the BimlStudio project.
